Little Robin redbreast sat upon a tree
Up went pussycat and down went he
Down came pussycat away Robin ran
Says little Robin Redbreast catch me if you can

Little Robin redbreast jumped upon a wall
Pussycat jumped after him and almost had a fall
Little Robin chirped and sang and what did pussy said
Pussycat said mew and Robin flew away
