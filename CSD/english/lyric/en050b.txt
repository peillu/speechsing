I wandered today to the hill Maggie
To watch the scene below
The creek and the old rusty mill Maggie
Where we sat in the long long ago

The green grove is gone from the hill Maggie
Where first the daisies sprung
The creeking old mill is still Maggie
Since you and I were young

A city so silent and lone Maggie
Where the young and the gay and the best
In polished white mansion of stone Maggie
Have each found a place of rest

Is built where the birds used to play Maggie
And joined in the songs that were sung
For we sang just as gay as they Maggie
When you and I were young
