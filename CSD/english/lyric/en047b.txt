He promised to buy me a trinket to please me
And then for a smile oh he vowed he would tease me
He promised to bring me a bunch of red roses
To tie up my bonny brown hair

Oh dear What can the matter be
Oh dear What can the matter be
Oh dear What can the matter be
Johnny's so long at the fair

He promised to bring me a basket of puzzles
A garland of lilies, a gift of red roses
A little straw hat to set off the blue ribbons
that tie up my bonny brown hair

Oh dear What can the matter be
Oh dear What can the matter be
Oh dear What can the matter be
Johnny's so long at the fair
