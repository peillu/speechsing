I've been working on the railroad
all the live long day
I've been working on the railroad
just to pass the time away

Can't you hear the whistle blowing
rise up early in the morn
can't you hear the captain shouting
Dinah blow your horn

Dinah won't you blow
Dinah won't you blow
Dinah won't you blow your horn
Dinah won't you blow
Dinah won't you blow
Dinah won't you blow your horn

Singing fee fie fiddly i oh
fee fie fiddly i oh oh oh oh
fee fie fiddly i oh
strumming on the old banjo

Singing fee fie fiddly i oh
fee fie fiddly i oh oh oh oh
fee fie fiddly i oh
strumming on the old banjo
