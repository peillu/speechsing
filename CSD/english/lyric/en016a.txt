My grandfather's clock was too large for the shelf
So it stood ninety years on the floor

It was taller by half than the old man himself
Though it weighed not a pennyweight more

It was bought on the morn of the day that he was born
And was always his treasure and pride

But it stopped short never to go again
When the old man died

Ninety years without slumbering
tic toc tic toc

His life seconds numbering
tic toc tic toc

It stopped short never to go again
When the old man died
