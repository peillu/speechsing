Rudolph the red nosed reindeer had a very shiny nose
And if you ever saw it you would even say it glows
All of the other reindeer used to laugh and call him names
They never let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve Santa came to say
Rudolph with your nose so bright won't you guide my sleigh tonight
Then how the reindeer loved him as they shouted it out with glee
Rudolph the red nosed reindeer you'll go down in history
