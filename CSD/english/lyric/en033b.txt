Mid pleasures and palaces through a we may roam
Be it ever so humble there's no place like home
A charm from the skies seems to hallow us there
Which seek through the world is ne'er met with elsewhere
Home home sweet sweet home
There's no place like home
There's no place like home

An exile from home splendor dazzles in vain
Oh give me my lowly thatched cottage again
The birds singing gaily that come at my call
Give me them with the peace of mind dearer than all
Home home sweet sweet home
There's no place like home 
there's no place like home
