If all the raindrops were lemon drops and gumdrops
Oh what a rain that would be
standing outside with my mouth open wide
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
If all the raindrops were lemon drops and gumdrops
Oh what a rain that would be

If all the snowflakes were candy bars and milkshakes
Oh what a snow that would be
standing outside with my mouth open wide
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
If all the snowflakes were candy bars and milkshakes
Oh what a snow that would be

If all the sunbeams were bubble gum and ice cream
Oh what a sun that would be
standing outside with my mouth open wide
Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah
If all the sunbeams were bubble gum and ice cream
Oh what a sun that would be
