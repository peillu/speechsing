Dashing through the snow on a one horse open sleigh
Over fields we go laughing all the way
Bells on bobtails ring making spirits bright
What fun it is to ride and sing a sleighing song tonight

Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh hey
Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride In a one horse open sleigh

Now the ground is white go it while you're young
Take the girls tonight sing this sleighing song
Get a bobtailed bay two forty for his speed
and hitch him to an open sleigh and you'll take the lead

Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh hey
Jingle bells jingle bells jingle all the way
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh
