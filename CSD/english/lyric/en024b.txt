Little bo peep has lost her sheep
and doesn't know where to find them
leave them alone and they'll come home
bringing their tails behind them

Little bo peep fell fast asleep
and dreamt she heard them bleating
but when she awoke she found it a joke
for they were all still fleeting

Then up she took her little crook
determine for to find them
she found them indeed but it made her heart bleed
for they left their tails behind them
