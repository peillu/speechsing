The little cockroach the little cockroach
All she wanted was to dance
She doesn't mind that her leg is missing
She would never miss the chance

The little cockroach the little cockroach
All she wanted was to dance
She doesn't mind that her leg is missing
She would never miss the chance

In the house nobody wants her
And they hunt her through the back door
So she goes after the music
And she's dancing on the dance floor 

In the house nobody wants her

The little cockroach the little cockroach
All she wanted was to dance
She doesn't mind that her leg is missing
She would never miss the chance

The little cockroach the little cockroach
All she wanted was to dance
She doesn't mind that her leg is missing
She would never miss the chance

She won't stay where they don't want her
There are better things to ask for
Now the music seems to charm her
As she's dancing on the dance floor

She won't stay where they don't want her
There are better things to ask for
Now the music seems to charm her
As she's dancing on the dance floor

The little cockroach the little cockroach
All she wanted was to dance
She doesn't bother if legs are missing
She would never miss the chance

All she wanted was to dance
She doesn't bother if legs are missing
She would never miss the chance
