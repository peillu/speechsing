Up and down the city road
in and out the eagle
that's the way the money goes
pop goes the weasel

A penny for a spool of thread
a nickel for a needle
that's the way the money goes
pop goes the weasel

All around the mulberry bush
the monkey chased the weasel
the monkey stopped to scratch his nose
pop goes the weasel

A penny for a spool of thread
a nickel for a needle
that's the way the money goes
pop goes the weasel
