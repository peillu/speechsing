Look out the window look out the window
See the snowflakes fall
Look out the window look out the window
Winter's come to cold
Children are singing sleigh bells are ringing as they sing along
Look out the window look out the window
Singing the winter song

Out there where the snowman stands only I can see
Children run to shake his hands for when the sun shines he'll be gone
Hurry hurry see the flurry
Winter won't last long
Look out the window look out the window
Singing the winter song

Look out the window look out the window
See the snowflakes fall
Look out the window look out the window
Winter's come to cold
Children are singing sleigh bells are ringing as they sing along
Look out the window look out the window
Singing the winter song

Out there where the snowman stands only I can see
Children run to shake his hands for when the sun shines he'll be gone
Hurry hurry see the flurry
Winter won't last long
Look out the window look out the window
Singing the winter song
