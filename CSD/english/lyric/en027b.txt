The cute little fellow went to a hen house
He tried to catch a chicken but it got away
A hungry fox was waiting outside 
I've got you he roared and stole away

Cackle, cackle the hen was crying
Cackle, cackle the hen was crying
The cute little fellow saw all of this and
He didn't know whether to laugh or to cry

The cute little fellow went to a pig pen
He tried to catch a pig but it got away
A hungry wolf was waiting outside
I've got you he roared and stole away
Squeal, queal, queal squeal the pig was crying
Squeal, queal, queal squeal the pig was crying
The cute little fellow saw all of this and
He didn't know whether to laugh or to cry
