Rock a bye baby on the treetop
When the wind blows the cradle will rock
When the bough breaks the cradle will fall
And down will come baby cradle and all

Baby is drowsing cozy and fair
Mother sits near in her rocking chairs
Forward and back the cradle she swings
Though baby sleeps she hears what she sings

Rock a bye baby do not you fear
Never mind baby mother is near
Wee little fingers eyes are shut tight
Now sound asleep until morning light
