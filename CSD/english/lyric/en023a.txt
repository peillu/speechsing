Should auld acquaintance be forgot
and never brought to mind
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
and auld lang syne

For auld lang syne my dear 
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup oh kindness yet
For auld lang syne  

And surely you'll be your pint stowp
And surely I'll be mine 
And we'll take a cup oh kindness yet
For auld lang syne

For auld lang syne my dear
For auld lang syne
We'll take a cup oh kindness yet
For auld lang syne
