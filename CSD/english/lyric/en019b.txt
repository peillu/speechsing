Oh holy night the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn

Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angels' voices
Oh night divine
Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine oh night
Oh night divine
