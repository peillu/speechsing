In a cavern in a canyon
Excavating for a mine
Dwelt a miner forty niner
And his daughter Clementine

Oh my darling oh my darling
Oh my darling Clementine
You were lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry Clementine

Light she was and like a fairy
And her shoes were number nine
Herring boxes without topses
Sandals were for Clementine

Oh my darling oh my darling
Oh my darling Clementine
You were lost and gone forever
Dreadful sorry Clementine
